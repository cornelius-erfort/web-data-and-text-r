## This week

-   Is webscraping ethical?
-   Is webscraping legal?
-   What can we do to be polite?

## Disclaimer

-   I am not a legal expert, so this is not legal advice!
-   I will focus on what you definitely should NOT do.
-   Scraping often happens in a gray area.

## Ethics

### Why care?

-   We don't want to harm anyone
-   Privacy regulation, GDPR
-   Publishers' ethical standards

## Ethics

### Personally identifiable information (PII)

-   What are PII?

GDPR: "'Personal data' means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (...)"

-   Name, email address, phone number, photos, date of birth, license plate number, ...

## Ethics

### Sensitive information

-   Racial or ethnic origin
-   Political opinions
-   Health data -...

## Ethics

### Privacy regulation, GDPR

-   Data collection needs a legal basis: consent or legitimate interest
-   Research may be a "legitimate interest"
-   Weigh the privacy rights with your right to research
-   Minimize data, anonymize, document,...

## Legal aspects

### Copyright laws

-   Applicable are usually the laws where you scrape
-   In Germany, almost every text is copyrighted
-   Be careful not to upload copyrighted material!
-   Be especially careful with commercial data (e.g. newspaper articles)!
-   Exception: Open Access Licenses

## Legal aspects

### "Text Data Mining"

-   New law (UrhG) since 2021
-   Generally allows scraping, even of copyrighted materials
-   Especially for non-commercial research
-   Does not allow to publish publicly!

## Legal aspects

### "Text Data Mining"

-   Written terms on a website might not be binding
-   But must respect technical barriers (e.g. robots.txt)

## Technical aspects

-   Technical barriers
-   Delays/rate limits
-   robots.txt

## Technical aspects

### Technical barriers

-   Password protection
-   Captchas
-   IP blocking
-   ...

## Technical aspects

### robots.txt

-   Concepts: User-agent, Directories/folders, Allow/Disallow, Delays
-   User-agent: Different rules for different users/robots
-   Directories: Different rules for different parts of the website

Example:

``` html
User-agent: *
Crawl-delay: 2
Allow: /files/

User-Agent: Googlebot
Disallow: /search/
```

## Technical aspects

### `polite` package

"Be responsible when scraping data from websites by following polite principles: introduce yourself, ask for permission, take slowly and never ask twice."

-   Automatically checks robots.txt
-   Adds delays
-   Adds headers
-   ...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Takeaways this week

-   Before you start scraping: Think about the legal and ethical implications of your project!
