# 08-recap-exercise

# Due on 20 June 2023! 
# This means, you will be able to ask questions in next week's session.

# Your job is to build an entire scraper with the tools we learned.

# Find useful data on the internet that you want to scrape. 

# The data should be from non-commercial site, such as Wikipedia, 
# a government agency, or a party. (We will talk about this next week.)

# To not make it to hard, try finding a static website.

# The data should come from several HTMLs, so you have to use a for loop.

# The end result should be a dataframe with at least two columns.


# The scraper should include the following steps:

# 1. When your scraper stops, it should start where it left of. This includes
# saving any HTMLs/file you scrape, and not downloading files you already saved.

# 2. There should be some kind of progress feedback.

# 3. Your loop should not stop when there is an error, e.g. a broken link.
